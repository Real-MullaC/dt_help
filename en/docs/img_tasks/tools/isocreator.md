If you want to test the changes made to a Windows image, you can easily do so with the ISO creation tools, which include the **ISO creator** and the **Preinstallation Environment (PE) Helper**.

You will need the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), which you can download using the convenient link on the bottom left.

*This tool is available in DISMTools 0.5 and later.*
