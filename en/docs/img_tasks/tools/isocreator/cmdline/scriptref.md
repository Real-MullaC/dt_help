## Available scripts

Currently, 3 scripts are included:

### Initialize Networking (`initializenetwork.bat`)

This script initializes the networking stack in the Preinstallation Environment for use with network-ready applications, and also enables the firewall.

### Full Disk Copy (`fullcopy.bat`)

This script performs a full disk copy from one disk to another with robocopy.

Usage:

1. Enter the source drive letter
2. Enter the destination drive letter
3. Wait for the process to complete

### Capture Image (`imagecapture.bat`)

This script captures a Windows system drive into a WIM file that can be used later.

Usage:

1. Enter the source drive letter (the Windows installation to capture)
2. Enter the destination drive letter (where to save the WIM file)
3. Enter the WIM file name (for example, `install.wim`)
4. Enter the image name (for example, `Windows 11 Pro`)
5. Wait for the process to complete

After DISM completes, you will see a result screen.
