## Applying unattended answer files with the ISO creation tools

You can also copy your unattended answer file to a test ISO using the ISO creator. Simply check the "Unattended answer file" option and specify an answer file:

</p>

Then, after installing the operating system and performing serviceability tests, the Operatins System installer will apply your unattended answer file. Make sure that you leave the medium containing the answer file, or it may not be fully applied.
