## Improvements for ARM64-based Preinstallation Environments

The toolkit designed for Windows Preinstallation Environments (WinPE), which includes the Driver Installation Module, now supports the ARM64 architecture. This makes it compatible with such Preinstallation Environments. Here is a screenshot of the Driver Installation Module running on a Raspberry Pi:
