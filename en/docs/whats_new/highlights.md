# Release highlights

This new version of DISMTools comes with new features that enhance image management and servicing tasks. Here are some of its key changes.

If you want to take a look at everything that has changed though, check out the [release notes page](https://github.com/CodingWonders/DISMTools/releases/latest) for more information.

## A new coat of paint

DISMTools 0.7 includes refined default themes, with darker dark colors and lighter light colors. Using its new **theme engine**, you can customize it even more with more colors, including a revamped color scheme inspired on older releases of DISMTools. It also features a new editor with which you can make your own themes.

## Network-based deployment made easy, and more Preinstallation Environment features

The DISMTools Preinstallation Environment now includes support for PXE providers with the new PXE Helpers. In this version, support for the [Windows Deployment Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Deployment_Services) is included, though additional providers will be supported in the future.

The DISMTools PE also includes a new menu from which you can perform local or network-based deployments. It also lets you access a command line with built-in scripts that allow you to initialize networking stacks, capture sysprepped installations to Windows images, and more.

## New unattended answer file features suitable for both consumers and businesses

DISMTools 0.7 includes new features in the unattended answer file creation wizard. If you ever need to specify more settings for specific components, you can now make these changes using the wizard, and not the Editor mode. It also allows you to make devices join a domain powered by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) using a convenient wizard.

The underlying generator program ([*UnattendGen*](https://github.com/CodingWonders/UnattendGen)) has also become cross-platform, with support for Linux and macOS (*command-line only*).

## Overall refinements

This release also focuses on refining existing tasks and functionality to improve the user experience. For example, more items have received translations, the program is more reliable, and components have been updated to their latest versions.
