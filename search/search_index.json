If you are coming from this utility to DISMTools, here are some changes: User interfaces MSMG Toolkit is a terminal user interface (TUI) front-end with menus that you can operate by pressing a keyboard button. This is still intuitive, but not as much as a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end; which DISMTools and other UIs are. Operations With MSMG Toolkit, you have to copy the files from a Windows Setup disc to the ISO folder of the Toolkit launch directory and specify a Windows image to customize. With DISMTools, however, you don't have to. You only have to copy the Windows image you want from the sources directory of the Windows Setup disc to any location, create a project, and mount the image to it. If you've loaded a Windows image into MSMG Toolkit and closed it, the program will unmount it. If you force the closure of the program and launch it again, it will remove EVERY file from the Windows image, making it invalid and unrepairable . This can be done because the Toolkit is launched as TrustedInstaller by default. You don't need to worry about that with DISMTools. After mounting an image to a project, it will stay there, even if you close the program; until you want to unmount it. Also, the program will leave the mounted images alone when starting up, apart from reloading their servicing sessions if the images need a remount.

The Windows Imaging format (WIM for short) made installation and management faster and easier, since WIM files would contain an entire Windows installation; as opposed to the old method of copying files from installation media. With Windows Vista, Microsoft also introduced the Automated Installation Kit (AIK), which contains the deployment tools necessary for that operating system. Tools, such as ImageX (deploys images), Package Manager (deploys packages), IntlCfg (configures regional settings) or more; were included with this kit. However, Microsoft wanted to create a solution that would streamline the deployment process. Their answer was the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool, which does every action performed by the aforementioned utilities in a single command-line program. DISM was released alongside Windows 7, and has been improved since; with the addition of the API, PowerShell cmdlets and more. Nowadays, if you want to manage Windows images, DISM is one tool to master. Interfaces A couple of DISM graphical user interfaces have been developed to simplify tasks with DISM. The most well-known tool is NTLite , which allows you to integrate packages, features and updates; and allows for unattended installations. Open-source alternatives are also available, such as: MSMG Toolkit DISM GUI DISM++ And, since you're browsing this site, DISMTools is another new alternative.

First steps The DISMTools tour DISMTools 0.7 introduces a new tour that you can follow in order to perform basic tasks. This tour features text and video forms, and focuses on an example procedure to create a customized Windows image. You can access it here The existing tour will be kept for legacy purposes for now. Keep reading if you want to follow this instead. After installation has completed, you may run the program. The following steps are recommended to be done in order to get started Creating your first project With the program up and running, you'll begin by creating a project . Use the first link in the main screen, or go to File -> New project... You'll see the following screen, in which you need to provide a name and a location. After providing data on both fields, click OK. The project will be created and you'll be at the project screen. To load this project later, go to \"Open an existing project...\" and specify the project location. If you have loaded a project recently, it's added to the Recents list. To access a project, double-click its entry in the list; and to remove an entry select it and click Remove entry. Loading a Windows image The first thing you need to do after creating a project is to load an image to it. There are 2 ways to do this: Mounting a Windows image To mount a Windows image, either click the \"Mount image...\" button, or click the link in the left panel. You'll see this screen: Specify the source image file you want to mount and the path you want to mount the image to. You can also configure more settings from this dialog, if you wish. Follow the image mount guide for more information. INFO: the easiest way of getting a Windows image is by extracting the sources\\install.wim file from Windows installation media. This can be easily done by mounting the ISO in the File Explorer or by using 3rd party tools, like 7-Zip. Once you're done, click OK and wait for the image to be mounted. Finally, you have finished! Loading an already existing mount directory Since DISMTools 0.2, the program lets you load a mount directory and use it in your project if you've already mounted a Windows image to it. To do this, switch to the \"Image\" tab on the left and click the link on the bottom. Next, specify the mount directory and click OK. That's it! To look for available mounted images, use the mounted image manager . NOTE: since version 0.3.2, the aforementioned link will open a popup mounted image picker, instead of a folder browser, that makes this process easier. Simply select a mounted image from the list and click OK: Best practices When creating a project and/or managing Windows images, consider these best practices: Project paths Store your project on a location whose length is not greater than the MAX_PATH path length limitation (260 characters) A great place to store your project on would be at the root of your preferred drive, or in a folder 1 level deep. Such examples would be: D:\\ or E:\\Projects\\ You can disable this limitation if you're using Windows 10, version 1607 or later, by following these guides DISM operations An antivirus program may prevent you from doing an image task, so it's recommended to set an exclusion to the mount path of the image It's not recommended to mount more than 20 images at the same time, as it can cause significant performance degradation You must run this program and, at any time, DISM as an administrator, no matter what privileges you may have If you have mounted the image with write privileges enabled, it's best to commit your changes often. That way, if the image becomes corrupt, it's easier to recover it It's not recommended to store files on network shares, as it can be faster to perform most operations if the files are copied to a local disk Servicing from Windows PE If you plan on servicing images from a Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE), consider these requirements while planning your strategy: Booting Windows PE from a local disk: you can allocate additional memory to your Windows PE installation when booting it from a local disk, to increase performance; and you can create temporary folders to store large updates Booting Windows PE from read-only media: if you plan on booting the Windows PE installation from optical media, ensure that your computer has enough memory Add a page file to your PE installation: to improve memory management, consider creating a page file.

Otherwise, you may get error code 0xc1570113 . More information can be found here . You may also need to properly register the application to the operating system for it to fully work, a guide for which is explained later in this page. This action is supported on DISMTools 0.2 and newer Usage Add any application file you want to add to a Windows image, which can be in the .appx , .msix , .appxbundle or .msixbundle format, to the AppX package list . This can be done by using the buttons on the bottom of the dialog, or by dropping them from an elevated application. If an application contains dependencies, be sure to add these to the AppX dependency list , by using the buttons below or by dropping them from an elevated application App Installer support DISMTools 0.3.2 expands the AppX addition capabilities by supporting App Installer files. Simply specify an .appinstaller file or drop it in the package addition list view, and let the program deal with it. You can learn more about App Installer files here . Encrypted application support DISMTools 0.5 introduces the ability to add encrypted application packages ( .eappx , .emsix , .eappxbundle , and .emsixbundle files) to active installations . Simply add those, just like you would with regular applications. For standard encrypted applications (not bundles), you can also view standard information about them, thanks to a modified version of UnpEax : Encrypted application bundle package support will come in a future version. You may notice that all options are disabled. This is because the program uses a PowerShell command to add these applications, as they can't be added using DISM. Options A license file may be required for an application to be installed, which you can specify in the license file text box. Otherwise, select \"Skip license\" If you want, you can provide a custom data file If you want to provision applications in some regions, specify them, separated by a semi-colon (;); following the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 or Alpha 3 codes NOTE: specifying a region requires DISM for Windows 10 and/or a Windows 10 or later image. New to DISMTools 0.5.1 and later! If you want, you can configure stub package preferences for your applications. Think of these as temporary packages that download the full version of an application. Setting an application to use the full package will explicitly install the full version of the package. NOTE: you can only configure stub package preferences if the following criteria are met: I. The DISM version used and the Windows image serviced are Windows 10 and later II. The application contains stub packages If you want, you can commit the image after adding the selected AppX packages . Questions Q: Where can I download app packages? A: You can make use of the Microsoft Store Generation Project and the web version of the Microsoft Store . Follow these steps: Load the Microsoft Apps website and search for the application you are looking for Once you've found your desired application, copy its link . It will be useful for the generation project Load the generation project website and paste the link you've copied If the server returns results, download the desired version of the AppX package and its dependencies If your browser complains about the safety of the files, confirm you want to download them. Q: I've installed an application on an online installation using this method, but the application doesn't work. Why? A: This may occur because the application is not fully registered. To do this, you need to make use of the registry and PowerShell: Open the Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications and grab the name of the application you want to register Next, open PowerShell as an administrator and type the following: Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\" | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (where *<PackageName>* is the name of the package you want to register) If the command complains about %SYSTEMDRIVE% being in the Path value, replace it with the drive you've booted to, like this: (Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\").Replace('%SYSTEMDRIVE%', 'C:').Trim() | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (obviously, replace \"C:\" with your boot drive) If the command complains about a missing dependency, download it, then add it using DISM, then use the same procedure The application should be fully registered now. Do note that the application will still not work if you are logged into the built-in Administrator account. In that case, you need to create a new user.

A: You can make use of the Microsoft Store Generation Project and the web version of the Microsoft Store . Follow these steps: Load the Microsoft Apps website and search for the application you are looking for Once you've found your desired application, copy its link . It will be useful for the generation project Load the generation project website and paste the link you've copied If the server returns results, download the desired version of the AppX package and its dependencies If your browser complains about the safety of the files, confirm you want to download them. Q: I've installed an application on an online installation using this method, but the application doesn't work. Why? A: This may occur because the application is not fully registered. To do this, you need to make use of the registry and PowerShell: Open the Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications and grab the name of the application you want to register Next, open PowerShell as an administrator and type the following: Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\" | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (where *<PackageName>* is the name of the package you want to register) If the command complains about %SYSTEMDRIVE% being in the Path value, replace it with the drive you've booted to, like this: (Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\").Replace('%SYSTEMDRIVE%', 'C:').Trim() | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (obviously, replace \"C:\" with your boot drive) If the command complains about a missing dependency, download it, then add it using DISM, then use the same procedure The application should be fully registered now. Do note that the application will still not work if you are logged into the built-in Administrator account. In that case, you need to create a new user.","title":"Questions"},{"location":"img_tasks/appx/add_provisionedappxpackage.html#related-topics","text":"Command-line help","title":"Related topics"},{"location":"img_tasks/appx/appx.html","text":"Overview of AppX packages With Windows 8 , Microsoft introduced a new kind of applications, Metro-style apps, that work with the operating system's new interface and design guidelines. These apps are packed in the AppX format, and can be deployed with DISM or with the PowerShell cmdlets provided by the Appx module. DISMTools 0.2 introduced AppX package servicing, which allows you to add and remove these applications to and/or from Windows images and/or online installations. Inside an AppX package NOTE: this information is based on how applications are packed in the MSIX format, but this also applies to AppX packages. An overview of the MSIX packaging format can be accessed here . However, this information focuses on more technical things about these packages This is the overall structure of an AppX package: Source: Microsoft However, the placement of some files varies depending on the format of the application: .appx and .msix packages contain the manifest on the root of the package, as AppxManifest.xml .appxbundle and .msixbundle packages store the manifest as AppxBundleManifest.xml , under the AppxMetadata directory We are interested in the manifest file because it provides information about the application : its name, its publisher info, its version and, most importantly, its dependencies. NOTE: if you've ever stumbled upon an .eappx or .emsix package, these cannot be opened or deployed through DISM , and need to be deployed using the Add-AppxPackage cmdlet Let's look at a manifest file. This is the manifest file of Rayman Jungle Run : If you can't read the selected text, here it is in code view: <Identity Name=\"UbisoftEntertainment.RaymanJungleRun\" Publisher=\"CN=C6D89DF1-FB66-4AAD-9100-AD9BE1186BE1\" Version=\"1.2.0.88\" ProcessorArchitecture=\"x86\" /> This is the information you'll see when adding AppX packages with DISMTools: The aforementioned line of XML code can be located on line 3 of the manifest, or on line 10 if a comment begins on line 3. Now, how can DISMTools detect the store logo asset ? By using the manifest file. Shortly after the XML code mentioned, a <Properties> tag begins, which contains information about the package display name (or how it will be shown on the start menu), the display name of the publisher , and the location of the store logo asset . Based on the last property, DISMTools goes through the AppX package and extracts the store logo asset, if it can. Otherwise, it will show a generic icon. The location of the store logo asset also varies depending on the format of the application. In .appxbundle and .msixbundle packages, it is stored in another AppX package inside its parent package, in which the store logo asset can be extracted from the same location. With the store logo asset on hand, DISMTools copies it to a store logo asset cache, so that it doesn't extract the asset again if it exists in the cache. App Installer files At some point you may run into this type of package and wonder what it is. App Installer files are XML files that declare the download URL for the main package (which is usually a bundle file). Let's look at them: INFO: you can view the structure of these files in any text editor, like Notepad What we're interested in is the <MainBundle> section, which defines the package name, publisher, version, and the main package download URL.

For more information, go to the image unmount page. Reloading the servicing session/repairing the component store Depending on the state of the mounted image, the program will let you do one task or the other. If its status is Needs remount , you will be able to reload the servicing session of the mounted image If its status is Invalid , you may be able to repair the component store of the mounted image. The ability you have depends on whether the image can be repaired or not. If it can't be repaired, your only choice is to discard it Enabling write permissions If you want to make changes to a read-only mounted image, you need to enable write permissions . This process will unmount the image and then mount it with write permissions. Do note that the image must be present in its location and must not be in read-only media in order for this process to complete successfully. Accessing the mount directory This will open the mount directory in File Explorer, allowing you to browse the files of the Windows image. This is similar to an active installation, so don't delete any files you don't know what they do. Removing volume images If the mounted image contains more than 1 index, you are able to remove volume images from it easily. Specify the indexes to remove, and click OK. For more information, refer to the volume image removal page. Loading mounted images If you've opened a project with no images loaded, you can easily load the mounted image you want to the project. Command-line version DISMTools 0.3 introduces a command-line version of the mounted image manager with which you can easily manage your mounted images as well. Differences from the GUI version The mounted image list is not updated automatically in the CLI version Accessing this version You can access the CLI version of the mounted image manager through the Command Console in the Tools menu by typing mimgmgr . You will then see an overview of the mounted images: Usage When you load this version of the mounted image manager, you need to mark an image for management . You can easily do this by pressing the M key and selecting an image using its number. If the list was modified in the background, you'll see an updated list. After marking an image, you can then perform management actions with it. Tasks These are the tasks you can do with this version of the mounted image manager: If you want to switch to another image, you can mark it (M key) Depending on the status of the image (R key): If it needs a servicing session reload ( Status: NeedsRemount ), you can reload it If it needs a component store repair ( Status: Invalid ), you can repair it When you've finished working with an image, you can unmount it (U key) You can access its mount directory (A key) If the image contains multiple indexes (volume images), you can remove those from it (V key) or switch to another index (S key, DISMTools 0.3.3 and later ) If images were mounted or unmounted from an external program, you can update the mounted image listing (L key) If the image is mounted with read-only privileges, you can enable write permissions (E key) Then, press ENTER to perform an action.

This section will cover both tasks. Checking Server Roles To successfully deploy operating systems via the network, you will need the following server roles: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Windows Deployment Services NOTE: you can have a different server that acts as the DHCP server. In that case, you only need the WDS role: You should be able to determine whether they are installed by simply searching for the management tools: NOTE: if you don't use WDS, do not install the WDS role. This guide assumes that you will use WDS. However, DHCP is still required for PXE booting. If not present, it's time to assess the current situation of the server. To do this: Go to Server Manager Click \"Add roles and features\", and perform a role-based or feature-based installation Select your server, and check which roles are present. Both must be installed: Based on this: If they are not installed: Check both DHCP and WDS and continue installation, whilst including management tools Continue without modifying any features, unless you want to enable or disable some of them Read the instructions for DHCP carefully In the configuration of the WDS role, leave both servers (deployment and transport) checked Proceed with the installation. After installing the roles, you will see that a role needs configuration. That is the DHCP role. As stated earlier, perform the configuration of the DHCP server Click \"Commit\" and \"Close\": If they are installed, but the management tools are not present: You will have to enable the DHCPServer-Tools and Microsoft-Windows-Deployment-Services-Admin-Pack features. You can do this by enabling the features from within the online installation management mode . You may have to restart the server after enabling the features. Preparing the network infrastructure If you already have a network infrastructure set up for remote deployment, feel free to skip this step. However, if you just want to tinker with remote installations at home with a wireless connection, you can do the following steps to create a virtual switch ( vSwitch ). Notes: These steps only work with Hyper-V After rebooting your host computer, your virtual machines connected to your switch may lose connection to the Internet. However, the switch will still function for remote OS installation Additional data consumption may occur To set up the virtual switch: In Hyper-V Manager, open the virtual switch manager and set up a new Internal switch. Give it the name you want, and click OK. You should have the following settings: After creating the switch, press Win + R and run ncpa.cpl . Then, double-click your wireless NIC ( Network Interface Card ) and go to the adapter settings Set up Internet Connection Sharing using the newly created switch. The resulting IP address from ICS is usually 192.168.137.1 Finally, configure the server to use the new switch: Turn on the server VM and run ipconfig /all to make sure the virtual network adapter is detecting the address used by Internet Connection Sharing as the default gateway. If so, then try pinging it: Tip: if you want to make sure the IP address of the server doesn't change (remains static), or if it can't pick up the default gateway address, go to the network adapter properties of the virtual network adapter, and configure IPv4 to use the following values: If the server can ping your computer, then you have a working vSwitch. You can now hook up the rest of the virtual machines you would like to use to that vSwitch. Configuring the DHCP Scopes NOTE: the contents of this section, introduced in earlier 0.7 Previews, have been moved to the WDS guide in order to show setups that work with other providers and not just WDS. This guide will only cover how to set up DHCP scopes for PXE. A DHCP server, in order to automatically assign IP addresses to clients, needs to have scopes with lengths that can contain the maximum amount of clients to use. If you already configured scopes, you can skip this step. Otherwise, keep reading. Open the DHCP management tool, select your server, then go to IPv4. We'll create a basic IPv4 scope using a unicast transmission (more common). Right-click IPv4 and select New scope. In the wizard, follow these steps: Give your scope a name and an optional description to better identify it: Next, provide an IP address range that will be used to provide addresses to clients (this is known as the address pool ). It should have the same subnet mask you have configured in your server. For this guide, we'll create a scope that can host addresses to 51 clients: If you don't want to assign addresses within a certain range, you can add exclusions to the scope. For this guide, we won't exclude addresses: Configure the scope lease duration. A DHCP lease to a client can last for a given time before the server gives a different IP address to said client. The default of 8 days is usually fine, unless it is meant to be something else in your environment: When asked to configure more details about the scope, select Yes and click Next. Then, specify the default gateway address for the scope. If you followed the guide on setting up the vSwitch, the gateway address you need to enter is the IP address offered by your host as part of Internet Connection Sharing. This is also the DNS address to add in the next screen if you set it up earlier: After configuring the gateway address and the DNS server address, leave the WINS server section as is and click Next. When you're asked to activate the scope, select No and click Next: In the newly created scope, right-click Scope Options, and select \"Configure Options...\": Then, configure the following options as follows based on your deployment solution: Provider Option Value <all> 66 IP address of TFTP server WDS 67 boot\\<arch>\\wdsnbp.com FOG 67 ipxe.efi (or other iPXE NBP binaries) For example, for WDS: Finally, right-click the scope and click \"Activate\" Final remarks You can configure the aforementioned settings either in this scope or globally.

You can obviously save these files anywhere. If you would like to learn more about the steps in this wizard, keep reading. Wizard Steps In the Regional Configuration page, you can set the language, system locale, keyboard layout and home location of the target system. Set these to values that suit your needs. Or, you can set them during the configuration of the applied operating system: In the System Configuration page, you can set the computer name, the architectures that you wish to target with your answer file, and other settings: Additional options include: Using a configuration set or distribution share : a configuration set can be used to preload applications and drivers into the target image. You can create these sets with the Windows System Image Manager. Make sure that there is a configuration set on the ISO file to which you are copying the answer file Windows 11 settings : these help you bypass the system requirements and network connection setup. Configure the latter if the target system does not have network capabilities. If you are looking to bypass this to be able to create local accounts, you can create the user accounts from this wizard as well In the Time Zone page, you can set the time zone of the target system: In the Disk Configuration page, you can set the disk configuration of the target system. You can let Setup give you the control over the disk configuration, or you can partition the first disk. You can also automate the entire disk configuration process by specifying DiskPart scripts: In the Product Key page, you can set the product key of the target system. You can choose from a generic product key tailored to the image edition, or you can type a custom product key: Notes: If you want to use a generic product key, choose the one tailored to your edition. Generic product keys are only meant for operating system installation, and will not activate the system If you want to use a custom product key, make sure that it is valid and that it is for the edition of the image. DISMTools will only check if the syntax of the product key is correct, but will not check if the product key is valid for installation or activation In the User Accounts page, you can create the local user accounts of the target system. You can create up to 5 accounts, and you can set the password of each account: From here, you can also enable auto-logon settings for the target system. But, if you don't want to use local accounts, or want the operating system to ask you, you can skip this step. You can also configure password expiration settings for the target system, but it is not recommended to do so, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Finally, you can configure Account Lockout policies for the target system, or disable them. The latter is not recommended, as it can make the system more vulnerable to brute-force attacks: Notes: At least one account must be part of the Administrators group In the Virtual Machine Support page, you can specify whether or not you want to install the integration features of your virtual machine provider (eg. VirtualBox Guest Additions or VMware Tools): In the Network Configuration page, you can specify whether the target system will connect to a wireless network: Notes: The authentication technology must be supported by both the wireless router and the network adapter of the target system. Make sure that the system contains a wireless adapter first If you don't want to set up a wireless network connection, or if the target system does not contain a wireless adapter, choose Skip configuration In the System Telemetry page, you can specify whether or not you want to send information to Microsoft and third-parties: Notes: Choosing Disable telemetry will not disable all sources of data collection. You will have to perform additional modifications to your Windows image in order to further reduce data collection In the Post-Installation Scripts page, you can configure additional scripts in PowerShell that will be run during Windows installation, or when accounts log on for the first time: You can either write the post-installation scripts from scratch, or import existing ones. Notes: After scripts are done, you can restart Windows Explorer in case you have applied personalization changes, for example, via the Registry If you are new to the world of post-installation scripts, you can go with new Starter Scripts. Go to the starter script reference section (at the bottom of this page) for more information In the Component Settings page, you can specify placeholders for additional components that you want to add to your answer file for specific passes. You will have to fill them in manually after the answer file is generated: Notes: You can learn more about the components here You can fill in the placeholders in the Editor mode, or in the Windows System Image Manager If you don't want to configure components, simply skip this step Finally, before creating the answer file, you can review the settings that you have configured in the wizard. If you want to change any settings, you can go back to the respective pages: After creating the answer file, you can create another one, open the file location, apply it, or edit it with the Editor mode or the Windows System Image Manager. Editor mode The editor mode lets you perform advanced customizations to your unattended answer file to add more things, like additional components or rules. You can operate the editor mode using the buttons in the toolbar. DISMTools 0.6.1 adds the ability to normalize the spacing of the answer file to make it consistent: Requirements The unattended answer file creator requires the .NET 9 Runtime for the generator program to function. If DISMTools detects that the runtime hasn't been installed, you will be offered the ability to use the self-contained version, which contains the runtime: If you decide to use this version, DISMTools will save this preference until the self-contained version is removed, either manually, or due to a program update. Downloading this version will take some time, depending on your network connection speed and computer performance. After the download is complete, you will see a notification in your system tray, depending on what icons are allowed to appear in the tray: Finally, like with the Windows Image Explorer , you can use the generator program separately. You can check out its repository here Active Directory Domain Services domain join If the unattended answer file and, by extension, the Windows image, will be targeted to a fleet of computers in a domain; you can configure domain join settings using the Domain Services Wizard . You can access the Domain Services Wizard by clicking the Join target device to domain... button that will appear in the following pages: System Configuration User Accounts Component Settings You will first need to configure target DNS server information: the primary domain suffix, the name of the NIC ( Interface Alias ), and DNS server addresses. You can specify the interface alias in one of 2 ways: By picking from available NICs in the current system. To choose this, it is recommended that you verify if you are running DISMTools in one of the devices in the domain, unless your current device also has a NIC with the same name as the target devices By typing the name of the NIC manually When you pick the NIC from the list, every other field (PDS, DNS server addresses) will be filled in automatically given the current configuration of the NIC. However, you can still change these fields if you need to use different values. For DNS server addresses, you need to put one address per line. If you want to check if the syntax of the addresses is correct, click Verify DNS Address Syntax . One example of filled-in information is shown below: After configuring DNS server information, you will need to configure information related to the initial user with which the target device will join the domain. If the device is part of a domain, the domain name will be filled in automatically and you will be able to pick users from available organizational units (OUs) in the domain. However, you can still specify different information manually. If the device is not part of a domain, you will need to specify all information manually. To pick a user from the domain: Select the OU from the drop-down list. After selecting the OU, the list of users in the OU will be populated automatically Select the user from the list Both the UPN and the SAM account names will be filled in automatically. When specifying this information manually, you will need to specify the user part of the UPN. For instance, johndoe . Finally, specify the password of the user. Since DISMTools will NOT check if the password is correct, make sure that you type it correctly. You've finished the Domain Services Wizard. When you get to the components screen, you will see that the necessary components and settings have been added to your answer file. Starter Script Reference Currently, there are 12 starter scripts available: Script Name Stage Description Close First Logon Animation During System Configuration This script closes the First Logon Animation process and allows a system to reach the desktop sooner. This works on Windows 10 and Windows 11. Enable Verbose Status Messages During System Configuration This script enables the verbose status messages that are enabled by default on Windows Server. This can help report service start/stop status. Set OEM Information During System Configuration This script configures OEM settings such as the manufacturer or the model to further customize a Windows installation. Set Quick Machine Recovery Settings During System Configuration This script configures a target system's Quick Machine Recovery settings on Windows 11 24H2 and later. Configure folders for Git integration When the first user logs on This script configures a folder, or a set of folders, for Git source control integration in the File Explorer. Git and the latest versions of system components need to be installed in the target system to take advantage of all features. Invoke WinUtil Configuration When the first user logs on This script configures a target system using a configuration file exported from the Windows Utility. Set Personalization Settings When the first user logs on This script configures settings related to color modes and accent colors on the user environment of the target system.

Set these to values that suit your needs. Or, you can set them during the configuration of the applied operating system: In the System Configuration page, you can set the computer name, the architectures that you wish to target with your answer file, and other settings: Additional options include: Using a configuration set or distribution share : a configuration set can be used to preload applications and drivers into the target image. You can create these sets with the Windows System Image Manager. Make sure that there is a configuration set on the ISO file to which you are copying the answer file Windows 11 settings : these help you bypass the system requirements and network connection setup. Configure the latter if the target system does not have network capabilities. If you are looking to bypass this to be able to create local accounts, you can create the user accounts from this wizard as well In the Time Zone page, you can set the time zone of the target system: In the Disk Configuration page, you can set the disk configuration of the target system. You can let Setup give you the control over the disk configuration, or you can partition the first disk. You can also automate the entire disk configuration process by specifying DiskPart scripts: In the Product Key page, you can set the product key of the target system. You can choose from a generic product key tailored to the image edition, or you can type a custom product key: Notes: If you want to use a generic product key, choose the one tailored to your edition. Generic product keys are only meant for operating system installation, and will not activate the system If you want to use a custom product key, make sure that it is valid and that it is for the edition of the image. DISMTools will only check if the syntax of the product key is correct, but will not check if the product key is valid for installation or activation In the User Accounts page, you can create the local user accounts of the target system. You can create up to 5 accounts, and you can set the password of each account: From here, you can also enable auto-logon settings for the target system. But, if you don't want to use local accounts, or want the operating system to ask you, you can skip this step. You can also configure password expiration settings for the target system, but it is not recommended to do so, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Finally, you can configure Account Lockout policies for the target system, or disable them. The latter is not recommended, as it can make the system more vulnerable to brute-force attacks: Notes: At least one account must be part of the Administrators group In the Virtual Machine Support page, you can specify whether or not you want to install the integration features of your virtual machine provider (eg. VirtualBox Guest Additions or VMware Tools): In the Network Configuration page, you can specify whether the target system will connect to a wireless network: Notes: The authentication technology must be supported by both the wireless router and the network adapter of the target system. Make sure that the system contains a wireless adapter first If you don't want to set up a wireless network connection, or if the target system does not contain a wireless adapter, choose Skip configuration In the System Telemetry page, you can specify whether or not you want to send information to Microsoft and third-parties: Notes: Choosing Disable telemetry will not disable all sources of data collection. You will have to perform additional modifications to your Windows image in order to further reduce data collection In the Post-Installation Scripts page, you can configure additional scripts in PowerShell that will be run during Windows installation, or when accounts log on for the first time: You can either write the post-installation scripts from scratch, or import existing ones. Notes: After scripts are done, you can restart Windows Explorer in case you have applied personalization changes, for example, via the Registry If you are new to the world of post-installation scripts, you can go with new Starter Scripts. Go to the starter script reference section (at the bottom of this page) for more information In the Component Settings page, you can specify placeholders for additional components that you want to add to your answer file for specific passes. You will have to fill them in manually after the answer file is generated: Notes: You can learn more about the components here You can fill in the placeholders in the Editor mode, or in the Windows System Image Manager If you don't want to configure components, simply skip this step Finally, before creating the answer file, you can review the settings that you have configured in the wizard.

General improvements to the PE Helper and PXE Helpers DISMTools 0.7.2 offers several improvements to the PE Helper and PXE Helper components. The Sysprep Preparation Tool now offers an automatic mode that prepares a reference computer with minimal user interaction. After preparation, the image capture script can now be launched automatically. Said script has also been improved to support capturing images to network locations using SMB shares and WDS servers. The PE Helper has also seen revamped ADK detection procedures that work more reliably, and updated logic for OSCDIMG error handling. The PXE Helper Server components can also be launched directly from the Tools menu on Windows servers. More starter scripts, more ways to customize your images; plus additional improvements to unattended answer file features The unattended answer file creation wizard now includes more starter scripts for enabling verbose status messages and configuring specific folders for Git integration in the File Explorer. Starter scripts have also been improved to provide name and description information, that can be viewed in the new starter script browser: Spice up the program's look with new themes Based on the theme engine introduced in DISMTools 0.7, this release adds new tinted themes in red, green, orange, and purple. Those who prefer a more minimal look can also go with the new Tinted Black and Tinted White themes, one for each color mode. Overall refinements This release also focuses on refining existing tasks and functionality to improve the user experience. For example, the program is more reliable and components have been updated to their latest versions.

Otherwise, you may get error code 0xc1570113 . More information can be found here . You may also need to properly register the application to the operating system for it to fully work, a guide for which is explained later in this page. This action is supported on DISMTools 0.2 and newer Usage Add any application file you want to add to a Windows image, which can be in the .appx , .msix , .appxbundle or .msixbundle format, to the AppX package list .

If an application contains dependencies, be sure to add these to the AppX dependency list , by using the buttons below or by dropping them from an elevated application App Installer support DISMTools 0.3.2 expands the AppX addition capabilities by supporting App Installer files. Simply specify an .appinstaller file or drop it in the package addition list view, and let the program deal with it. You can learn more about App Installer files here . Options A license file may be required for an application to be installed, which you can specify in the license file text box. Otherwise, select \"Skip license\" If you want, you can provide a custom data file If you want to provision applications in some regions, specify them, separated by a semi-colon (;); following the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 or Alpha 3 codes NOTE: specifying a region requires DISM for Windows 10 and/or a Windows 10 or later image. If you want, you can commit the image after adding the selected AppX packages . Questions Q: Where can I download app packages? A: You can make use of the Microsoft Store Generation Project and the web version of the Microsoft Store . Follow these steps: Load the Microsoft Apps website and search for the application you are looking for Once you've found your desired application, copy its link . It will be useful for the generation project Load the generation project website and paste the link you've copied If the server returns results, download the desired version of the AppX package and its dependencies If your browser complains about the safety of the files, confirm you want to download them. Q: I've installed an application on an online installation using this method, but the application doesn't work. Why? A: This may occur because the application is not fully registered. To do this, you need to make use of the registry and PowerShell: Open the Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications and grab the name of the application you want to register Next, open PowerShell as an administrator and type the following: Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\" | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (where *<PackageName>* is the name of the package you want to register) If the command complains about %SYSTEMDRIVE% being in the Path value, replace it with the drive you've booted to, like this: (Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\").Replace('%SYSTEMDRIVE%', 'C:').Trim() | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (obviously, replace \"C:\" with your boot drive) If the command complains about a missing dependency, download it, then add it using DISM, then use the same procedure The application should be fully registered now. Do note that the application will still not work if you are logged into the built-in Administrator account. In that case, you need to create a new user.
